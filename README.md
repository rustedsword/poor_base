Header only macro library

# <poor_array.h>
This header contains useful macros to work with arrays.
All macros here can operate on arrays or pointers to arrays by auto-dereferencing them using auto_arr() macro,
while checking that arguments are really arrays.

Before even considering to use this library you should completely understand how arrays work.

Arrays are not pointers. But in most operations they decay to pointer to it's first element.
```c
unit32_t a[5]; //Array of 5 uint32_t  
sizeof(a); // 5 * 4 = 20  //sizeof doesn't decay array to pointer
uint32_t *ptr = a;  //a decayed to pointer to first element 
```
Pointers to arrays are just like regular pointers, but they pointing to whole array.
```c
uint32_t (*b)[5]; //Pointer to array of 5 uint32_t  
sizeof(b);  //size of pointer itself  
sizeof(*b); //size of array where pointer points: 5 * 4 = 20  
```
You can't pass array by value into another function. If you declaring a function with array argument then that array decayed into pointer to first element, so it is not longer an array anymore.
```c
void fn(uint32_t a[5]); -> void fn(uint32_t *a);
void fn(uint32_t a[]);  -> void fn(uint32_t *a);
void fn(size_t len, uint32_t a[len]); -> void fn(size_t len, uint32_t *a);
```
If you declare a function with multi-dimensional array argument, then it is converted to pointer to it's first element too: pointer to subarray. So, you are losing dimension that way.
```c
void fn(uint32_t a[5][3]); -> void fn(uint32_t (*a)[3]);  
```
So, first thing is to consider that you should never declare functions with array arguments, you should always use pointers to arrays instead. Pointers to arrays do not decay. That approach allows to use C type system to warn the programmer if he passes pointer to array of wrong size or type. While inside function body you will keep all arrays' dimensions.
```c
void fn(uint32_t (*a)[5]) {  //Function accepts only pointer to array of 5 uint32_t  
    sizeof(*a); //20  
}  

void fn(uint32_t (*a)[4][6]) { //Function accepts only pointer to array of 4 arrays of 6 uint32_t  
    sizeof(*a); //96  
}  
```
When passing an array of size known only at run-time the traditional approach is to pass pointer to first element and array length. But this way has same problems as above: you no longer have an array inside function body: only two variables: pointer and length.  
```c
void fn(uint32_t *a, size_t len); --> WRONG  
```
So, when you want to pass an array of run-time length, you should use pointers to Variable Length Arrays(VLA)
```c
void fn(const size_t len, uint32_t (*a)[len]) {  
    sizeof(*a); //Returns length of array at runtime.  
}  
```
And now it is where this macro library comes into play. By using auto_arr() and ARRAY_SIZE() you can simplify such function calls.  
```c
#define fn(a) _fn(ARRAY_SIZE(a), &auto_arr(a))  
void _fn(const size_t len, uint32_t (*a)[len]) {  
    sizeof(*a); //Returns length of array at runtime.
}  

uint32_t w[6];  //static array
fn(w);  
  
size_t len = 9;  
uint32_t x[len];  //VLA
fn(x);  

uint32_t (*y)[6] = &w; //Pointer to static array
fn(y);

uint32_t (*z)[len] = &x; //Pointer to VLA
fn(z);
```

By keeping arrays' arrayness you can use all features of this library: array views, generic array iterators, information macros, and even treat arrays as static vectors.

## Generic Array Macros

### auto_arr(var) / arr(var)
Allows to work with pointers to arrays in the same way as with ordinary arrays

If argument is a pointer to an array then this macro will dereference it.  
If argument is an array, then this macro does nothing at all, returning array as is.  
If argument is not an array or a pointer to an array then compilation will be stopped.  

```c
int a[2] = {1,2};  
int (*b)[2] = &a;  
arr(a)[0] = 5;   
arr(b)[1] = 6; 
```
Used by other macros, so they can operate on arrays or pointers to arrays at the same time.

### ARRAY_SIZE(var)
Returns count of elements in the array.
```c
int a[5];   
int (*b)[2];  
ARRAY_SIZE(a); //5  
ARRAY_SIZE(b); //2  
```
### ARRAY_SIZE_BYTES(var)
Returns total array size

### ARRAY_ELEMENT_SIZE(var)
Returns size of array element

### PRINT_ARRAY_INFO(var)
Prints information about array
```c
int a[2];   
PRINT_ARRAY_INFO(a); //Array "a" at 0x0 has size:2 uses 8 bytes, while single element has size:4  

size_t len = 5;   
short b[len];   
PRINT_ARRAY_INFO(b); //VLA "b" at 0x0 has size:5 uses 10 bytes, while single element has size:2 
```
### copy_array(dst_arr, src_arr)
Copies data from array (src_arr) to array (dst_arr)  
Type of array elements may be compatible.  
If destination array is not long enough then only part of source array will be copied.  

### copy_arrays(dst_arr, src_arr0, src_arr1, ..., src_arrn)
Copies data from all source arrays into destination array.
Type of all arrays' elements should be same.  
Destination array should be long enough to fit all data from source arrays.

## ArrayView
A view of an array. It is just a pointer to array pointing into some part of another array.  
You can create a view from an array or from another view. View can be created from VLA or from a pointer to VLA.  
Arguments are statically validated by default, prohibiting creating out-of-bounds views at compile time.  
Optional run-time arguments validation.  

### (make_)arrview(idx, len, var)
Creates a view of array var, starting from position (idx) with len (len)
```c
uint8_t data[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5};  
make_arrview(data_slc, 2, 3, data); //Start index: 2 and size: 3  
print_array(data_slc); //prints: 234
```  
### (make_)arrview_first(len, var)
Create a view of the first (len) elements of the array (var)
```c
uint8_t data[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5};  
make_arrview_first(data_slc, 3, data);  
print_array(data_slc); //prints: 012
```
### (make_)arrview_last(len, var)
Create a view of the last (len) elements of the array (var)
```c
uint8_t data[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5};  
make_arrview(data_slc, 2, data);  
print_array(data_slc); //prints: 45
```
### (make_)arrview_shrink(start, end, var)
Create a view by skipping (start) elements from the begining and (end) elements from the end of the array (var)
```c
uint8_t data[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5};  
make_arrview_shrink(data_slc, 1, 2, data);  
print_array(data_slc); //prints: 123
```
### (make_)arrview_cfront(start, var)
Create a view by skipping (start) elements from the begining of the array (var)
```c
uint8_t data[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5};  
make_arrview_cfront(data_slc, 2, data);  
print_array(data_slc); //prints: 2345
```
### (make_)arrview_cback(end, var)
Create a view by skipping (end) elements from the end of the array (var)
```c
uint8_t data[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5};  
make_arrview_cback(data_slc, 2, data);  
print_array(data_slc); //prints: 0123
```
### (make_)arrview_full(var)
Create a full view of the array (var)
```c
uint8_t data[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5};  
make_arrview_full(data_slc, data);  
print_array(data_slc); //prints: 012345
```
### (make_)arrview_str(var)
Create a view of the array (var) without last elements. Useful for null-terminated strings.
